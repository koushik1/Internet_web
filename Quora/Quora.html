		See everything is related with food items.

If food items go up, then your maid, worker may ask more money from you because of increase in expenses.

Your savings will be reduced because you will be paying more for food items which means less travel vacations, outing in restaurants, less shopping etc. That means, you will be buying less things and less product will be sold. It will affect the whole market.

On top of that, the company may have to pay more to its employees because of rising living of cost and one more thing, raw material cost will go up too.

Just for example Cheese and Ice creams are made of milk and if milk prices go up ,Cheese and ice cream will also go up because higher cost will be involved in making.

Hence, overall profitability of companies will reduce because of less consumption and higher cost in making. Therefore it will affect the sensex.
